<!-- # Project Description -->

In our country, the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) provides some special vehicles for selling food items (Rice, pulses, edible oil, etc.) at a cheap rate for people who cannot afford them. Sadly, we find a lot of issues there, like, in most cases, one person buys products that were available for more than 10/12 people. For these reasons, most of the needy people cannot even buy the product even though they wait in line for a very long time. Product stealing is another major issue here. We tried to solve this problem by using our “Smart Aid and Relief Rover” project. We can easily distribute food items, medicines, or any other products by using our multipurpose smart truck.
